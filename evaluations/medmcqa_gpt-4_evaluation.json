The branches of the external carotid artery that contribute to Kiesselbach's plexus include the sphenopalatine artery, anterior ethmoidal artery, and septal branch of the superior labial artery. The greater palatine artery is not a branch of the external carotid artery and therefore does not contribute to Kiesselbach's plexus."

In a blue newborn with cyanosis and oligaemic lung fields on chest X-ray, the most likely diagnosis is pulmonary atresia. Pulmonary atresia is a congenital heart defect where there is complete obstruction of the pulmonary valve, leading to decreased blood flow to the lungs and resulting in cyanosis. The normal sized heart on X-ray helps to differentiate it from other congenital heart defects such as Ebstein's anomaly, transposition of great arteries, and tetralogy of Fallot."
