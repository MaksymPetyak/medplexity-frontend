One month ago, he received care in the emergency department for pain over his right flank following a motor vehicle collision. At that time, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg and CT scan of the abdomen showed an incidental 10-cm left adrenal mass.

One month ago, he received care in the emergency department for pain over his right flank following a motor vehicle collision. At that time, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg and CT scan of the abdomen showed an incidental 10-cm left adrenal mass. Results of laboratory studies, including complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, and liver function tests, were within the reference ranges. The patient otherwise had been healthy and had never been told that he had elevated blood pressure. He takes no medications. A follow-up visit in the office 2 weeks ago disclosed elevated urinary normetanephrine and metanephrine and plasma aldosterone concentrations. The patient was referred to a surgeon, who recommended the adrenalectomy. Today, vital signs are temperature 36.6\u00b0C (97.9\u00b0F), pulse 100/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 170/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses no significant findings.

She reports that the mass is painless and has grown very slowly over the past six months. She initially did not see a physician due to being very busy at her work as a lawyer. However, she reports that she noticed some right-sided facial weakness in the past week which prompted her to visit the physician. Her past medical history is notable for Hodgkins lymphoma as a child which required radiation therapy to the neck. She has a 20 pack-year smoking history and drinks alcohol socially. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/85 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals a painless firm mass at the angle of the right jaw. There is also a small palpable firm mass beneath the floor of the mouth. A right facial droop along with an inability to elevate her right eyebrow is noted. A biopsy of one of this lesion would most likely reveal which of the following?\n(A) Cystic configurations of anaplastic squamous and mucoid cells (B) Non-infiltrative clusters of epithelial and mesenchymal cells (C) Epithelial cells with dense lymphoid stroma and germinal centers (D) Large basophilic binucleate cells (E) Uniform spindle cells with scant cytoplasm and cigar-shaped nuclei\nOutput: "
