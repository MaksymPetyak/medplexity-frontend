The myelin sheath acts as an insulator, allowing for saltatory conduction of impulses. Membrane currents are generated at the nodes of Ranvier, which are the gaps in the myelin sheath. Local anesthesia is effective when the nerve is not covered by myelin sheath. Therefore, the statement that impulse through myelinated fibers is slower than non-myelinated fibers is not true."

The oncotic pressure of the fluid leaving the glomerular capillaries is actually greater than that of the fluid entering it. This is because the glomerular capillaries are highly permeable to water and small solutes, but not to large proteins. As a result, the concentration of proteins in the capillaries increases as fluid is filtered out, leading to an increase in oncotic pressure.
