Myelinated nerve fibers are wrapped in a myelin sheath, which increases the speed of nerve impulse conduction. This is because the myelin sheath allows the nerve impulse to jump from one node of Ranvier to the next, a process known as saltatory conduction. Therefore, the statement that impulse through myelinated fibers is slower than non-myelinated fibers is not true."

An ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) test measures the acidity (pH) and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood from an artery. This test is used to check how well your lungs are able to move oxygen into the blood and remove carbon dioxide from the blood. The radial artery is indeed the preferred site for an ABG. If the modified Allen's test is negative, a different site should be tried. Normal pH, HCO3, and PCO2 levels may not indicate absence of an acid-base imbalance. However, before performing the ABG, the syringe should be loaded with 1000 units/ml of heparin, not 0.3 cc."

        "explanation": "Before answering these questions lets first discuss hepatitis in brief.\nMaternal infection: The acute infection is manifested by flu like illness as malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. In majority, it remains asymptomatic. Jaundice is rare and fever is uncommon.\nClinical course (HBV): Nearly 90\u201395% of patients clear the infection and have full recovery. 1% develop fulminant hepatitis resulting massive hepatic necrosis. 10-15% become chronic and 10% of these chronic cases suffer from chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.\nDiagnosis is confirmed by serological detection of HBsAg, HBeAg (denote high infectivity) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and HBV DNA titer (107\u20131011).\nScreening: All pregnant women should be screened for HBV infection at first antenatal visit and it should be repeated during the third trimester for \u2018high risk\u2019 groups (intravenous drug abusers, sexual promiscuity, hemophilics, patients on hemodialysis or having multiple sex partners).\nHepatitis C (HCV):\nIt is recognized as the major cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis worldwide and is the leading cause of transfusion associated hepatitis. Transmission is mainly blood borne and to a lesser extent by faecal-oral route. It is responsible for chronic active hepatitis and hepatic failure.\nPerinatal transmission (10\u201340%) is high when coinfected with HIV and HBV.\nDetection is by antibody to HCV by EIA, which develops usually late in the infection.\nConfirmation is done by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA-3).\nChronic carrier state is present. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated.\nHepatitis D (HDV):\nIt is seen in patients infected with HBV either as a co-infection or super infection. Perinatal transmission is known.\nHepatitis E (HEV): Hepatitis E is the most important cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis in developing countries like India. Chronic carrier state is present. Perinatal transmission is uncommon.\nMaternal mortality is very high (15\u201320%).",

The risk of transmission of Hepatitis B from a mother who is Hbs Ag positive and anti Hbe Ag positive to her child is about 20%. This is because the presence of Hbe Ag is associated with high levels of viral replication and therefore increased infectivity. However, the mother in this case is anti-Hbe Ag positive, which means she has antibodies against Hbe Ag, indicating lower levels of viral replication and therefore a lower risk of transmission."

Atropine -It is highly effective in counter-acting the muscarinic symptoms, but higher doses are required to antagonize the central effects. It does not reverse peripheral muscular paralysis which is a nicotinic action. All cases of anti-ChE (carbamate or organophosphate) poisoning must be promptly given atropine2 mg i.v. repeated every 10 min till dryness of mouth or other signs of atropinization appear (upto 200 mg has been administered in a day). Continued treatment with maintenance doses may be required for 1-2 weeks. Neostigmine and physostigmine worsens the signs and symptoms as these also act by inhibiting choline esterase.

However, sensory loss in the facial area is not typically associated with myelopathy, as the trigeminal nerve (which provides sensation to the face) has its sensory nucleus in the brainstem, not the spinal cord."

The Rb gene product is a negative regulator of the cell cycle and prevents the cell from entering S phase. When it is phosphorylated, it becomes inactive, allowing the cell cycle to progress. If the Rb gene phosphorylation is defective, it will remain active and prevent the cell from progressing past the G1 phase. Therefore, the cell cycle will stop at the G1 phase."
